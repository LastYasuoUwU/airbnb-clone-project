- A Property can have many Bookings → (One-to-Many: properties → bookings).

- A Booking is linked to exactly one Payment → (One-to-One: bookings → payments).

- A Property can have many Reviews → (One-to-Many: properties → reviews).

- A User can write many Reviews → (One-to-Many: users → reviews).

- A Property can have many Images → (One-to-Many: properties → property_images).

- A User can save many Favorite Properties → (One-to-Many: users → favorites).

- A Property can be saved by many Users → (One-to-Many: properties → favorites).
