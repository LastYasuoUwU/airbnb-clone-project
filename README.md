## 📊 Entity-Relationship Design (ERD)

The relationships between entities in the Airbnb Clone Backend are as follows:

A User can create many Properties → (One-to-Many: users → properties).

A User can make many Bookings → (One-to-Many: users → bookings).

A Property can have many Bookings → (One-to-Many: properties → bookings).

A Booking is linked to exactly one Payment → (One-to-One: bookings → payments).

A Property can have many Reviews → (One-to-Many: properties → reviews).

A User can write many Reviews → (One-to-Many: users → reviews).

A Property can have many Images → (One-to-Many: properties → property_images).

A User can save many Favorite Properties → (One-to-Many: users → favorites).

A Property can be saved by many Users → (One-to-Many: properties → favorites).
