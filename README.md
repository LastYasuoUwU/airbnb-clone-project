## 🚀 Getting Started (Optional)

You can add setup instructions here, for example:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone-backend.git

# Navigate into the project
cd airbnb-clone-backend

# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

## 📊 Database Design

The relationships between entities in the Airbnb Clone Backend are as follows:

- A User can create many Properties → (One-to-Many: users → properties).

- A User can make many Bookings → (One-to-Many: users → bookings).

- A Property can have many Bookings → (One-to-Many: properties → bookings).

- A Booking is linked to exactly one Payment → (One-to-One: bookings → payments).

- A Property can have many Reviews → (One-to-Many: properties → reviews).

- A User can write many Reviews → (One-to-Many: users → reviews).

- A Property can have many Images → (One-to-Many: properties → property_images).

- A User can save many Favorite Properties → (One-to-Many: users → favorites).

- A Property can be saved by many Users → (One-to-Many: properties → favorites).

## 🔎 Feature Breakdown

### 👤 User Management

Provides secure registration, authentication, and profile management for both guests and hosts.  
This ensures that users can safely create accounts, manage their profiles, and access platform features.

### 🏠 Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings with details such as location, pricing, and availability.  
This allows guests to browse accurate property information and make informed booking decisions.

### 📅 Booking System

Enables users to reserve properties with check-in and check-out dates.  
The system ensures availability, manages conflicts, and tracks the status of each booking.

### 💳 Payment Processing

Handles financial transactions related to bookings, ensuring secure and reliable payments.  
It records transaction details and updates booking status upon successful payment.

### ⭐ Review System

Allows guests to leave ratings and feedback on properties after their stay.  
Reviews build trust, improve transparency, and help future guests choose the best accommodations.

### ⚡ Data Optimization

Implements database indexing and caching strategies for faster queries and reduced load.  
This ensures smooth performance, even as the platform scales with more users and listings.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone backend to ensure safe and reliable interactions between users, hosts, and the system.  
The following measures are implemented to protect user data, property information, and financial transactions:

### 🔑 Authentication

- Uses secure login and token-based authentication (JWT or OAuth2).
- Ensures that only verified users can access the system and prevents unauthorized access.

### 🛂 Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for guests, hosts, and admins.
- Guarantees that users can only perform actions they are permitted to (e.g., only hosts can create listings).

### 📉 Rate Limiting

- Prevents abuse of the API through excessive requests.
- Helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and protects system stability.

### 🔒 Data Protection

- All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) is encrypted in storage and transit (HTTPS/TLS).
- Protects user privacy and prevents data leaks.

### 💳 Secure Payments

- Integrates with trusted third-party payment providers.
- Ensures financial transactions are safe, reducing risks of fraud and chargebacks.

Security is essential to **protect user accounts**, **safeguard property and booking data**, and **guarantee payment integrity**—all of which are vital for user trust and the platform’s success.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code.  
For the Airbnb Clone backend, implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures that new features and bug fixes are reliably integrated, tested, and deployed without manual intervention, reducing errors and improving development speed.

### Key Benefits

- **Automated Testing**: Ensures that code changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Faster Deployment**: Updates can be pushed to production quickly and consistently.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can safely contribute without worrying about integration conflicts.

### Recommended Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: Automate testing, building, and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Containerize the backend for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Celery & Redis**: Handle asynchronous tasks reliably within the deployment pipeline.
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensures the database is properly migrated and seeded during deployment.
